<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm currently navigating the exciting world of engineering at IIT Kharagpur,
  where I'm pursuing a dual degree in Civil Engineering (B.Tech + M.Tech). 
  But hey, life isn't all about equations and blueprints! </p>

<p>Back in my school days, I rocked the boards with a sweet 96% in class 10, securing the second position in the entire state! 
  Class 12 wasn't too shabby either, with an 85.8% to my name. Yep, those were the days of late-night cram sessions and endless cups of coffee!.
  <br />Now, let's talk about what makes my heart sing: writing. I'm a sucker for poetry, shayari, and ghazals. 
  There's something magical about stringing words together to create emotion. And guess what? I've even dabbled in storytelling - there's a whole 
  universe inside my head waiting to be shared.<br />
  When I'm not lost in the world of words, you'll find me on the cricket field, channeling my inner sport person. There's nothing quite 
  like the crack of the bat and the thrill of victory!<br />
  Oh, and did I mention my newfound fascination with filmmaking? Yup, I'm ready to trade my pen for a camera 
  and bring my stories to life on the big screen.
</p>

<p>So, that's me in a nutshell - a curious engineering student with a passion for writing, 
  cricket, and the occasional cinematic adventure. <br />Life's a journey, and I'm just getting started!</p>
